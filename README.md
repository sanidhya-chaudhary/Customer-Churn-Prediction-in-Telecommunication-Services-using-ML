# Customer-Churn-Prediction-in-Telecommunication-Services-using-ML

## Problem Statement
What's the % of Customers Churn and customers that keep in with the active services?
Is there any patterns in Customers Churn based on the gender?
Is there any patterns/preference in Customers Churn based on the type of service provided?
What's the most profitable service types?
Which features and services are most profitable?
Which features have the most impact on predicting customers churn?
Which model is the best for predicting churn?

## Introduction
In the Telecommunication Industry, customer churn detection is one of the most important research topics that the company has to deal with retaining on-hand customers. Churn means  the  loss  of  customers due  to  exiting  offers  of  the competitors or maybe due to network issues. In these types of situations, the customer may tend to cancel the subscription to a service. Churn rate has a substantial impact on the lifetime value of the  customer because it affects  the future revenue  of the company and also the length of service. Due to a direct effect on the income of the industry, the companies are looking for a model that can predict customer churn. The model developed in this work  uses  machine  learning  techniques.  By  using  machine learning algorithms, we can predict the customers who are likely to cancel the subscription. Using this, we can offer them better services and reduce the churn rate. These models help telecom services to  make them  profitable. In  this model,  we used  a Logistic regression, KNN, LightGB, Random Forest, Ada Boost, ExtraTree Classifier, Super Learner, Stacking and XGBoost. 

Customer churn is the percentage of customers that stopped using company's product or service during a certain time frame. Customer churn is one of the most important metrics for a growing business to evaluate as it is much less expensive to retain existing customers than it is to acquire new customers. Customers in the telecom industry can choose from a variety of service providers and actively switch from one to the next. The telecommunications business has an annual churn rate of 15-25 percent in this highly competitive market.

Individualized customer retention is demanding because most companies have a large number of customers and cannot afford to devote much time to each of them. The costs would be too great, outweighing the additional revenue. However, if a corporation could forecast which customers are likely to leave ahead of time, it could concentrate customer retention efforts only on these "high risk" clients.

## DATASET INFO
The dataset appears to contain information about customers of a telecommunications company. Each row represents a customer, and the columns provide details about various attributes associated with each customer. Cell2Cell dataset is preprocessed and a balanced version provided for analyzing Process. consists of 71,047 instances and 58 attributes.
The "Cell2Cell" dataset is a simulated customer database often used in predictive modeling and analytics. It typically contains information about customers such as demographics, usage patterns, and churn status (whether they have switched to a competitor or not). The dataset is designed to mimic real-world telecommunications customer data and is used for tasks like customer churn prediction, customer segmentation, and customer behavior analysis. It's a common dataset used in machine learning and data mining courses and competitions.
